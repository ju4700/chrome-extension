### How to Install the Musafir Extension on Chrome Using a .crx File

Here‚Äôs how you can install it using the `musafir.crx` file‚Äîno tech skills needed, I promise! Just follow these steps:

#### Steps to Install
1. **Grab the .crx File**:  
   - Download `musafir.crx` from my official support page: [https://ju4700.github.io/chrome-extension/downloads/musafir.crx](https://ju4700.github.io/chrome-extension/downloads/musafir.crx). It‚Äôs a safe link, so no worries!

2. **Turn On Developer Mode in Chrome**:  
   - Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar, then hit Enter.  
   - In the top-right corner, you‚Äôll see a toggle for **Developer mode**. Flip it to **on**. This lets you install extensions manually.

3. **Add the .crx File to Chrome**:  
   - Find the `musafir.crx` file you downloaded (probably in your Downloads folder).  
   - Drag the file and drop it onto the `chrome://extensions/` page in Chrome.  
   - A pop-up will ask, ‚ÄúAdd ‚ÄòMusafir‚Äô?‚Äù with two buttons: **Add extension** or **Cancel**. Click **Add extension**, and you‚Äôre good to go!

4. **Check That It Worked**:  
   - You‚Äôll see Musafir listed on the `chrome://extensions/` page with its own ID.  
   - Look for the Musafir icon in your Chrome toolbar (it might be under the puzzle piece icon‚Äîclick it and pin Musafir to make it easier to find).  
   - Give it a quick test: open the extension, set a timer, and try visiting a blocked site (like *.porn or *.xxx). It should redirect you to a safe page.

#### A Few Things to Know
- **Heads-Up on Security**:  
   Chrome might show a warning like, ‚ÄúThis extension isn‚Äôt from the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge.‚Äù Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit‚Äôs just Chrome being cautious since I haven‚Äôt published it on the Web Store yet. You‚Äôre safe since you got it straight from me!
  
- **Updates**:  
   Since this is a manual install, Musafir won‚Äôt auto-update. If I release a new version, I‚Äôll let you know, and you‚Äôll just need to download the updated `.crx` file and repeat these steps.

- **Keep Developer Mode On**:  
   For Musafir to work, you‚Äôll need to leave Developer mode turned on in Chrome. If you turn it off, Chrome might disable the extension. Alternatively, I‚Äôm working on getting it onto the Chrome Web Store for a smoother experience soon!

- **Custom Blocks**: Users can add domains or regex patterns via settings.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: `webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate` and `declarativeNetRequest` redirect matching URLs.

### Tamper Resistance
- **Alarms**: Checks state every 15 seconds, reloads if tampered.
- **Management**: Re-enables the extension if disabled during an active period.

### Timer
- Irreversible once set, managed by `enforceTimer` in `background.js`.
- Syncs with `popup.js` for real-time countdown.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Service Worker Registration Failed (Status Code 15)**:
   - **Cause**: Syntax error or missing file.
   - **Fix**: Check `background.js` for errors, ensure all files are in the root directory, and reload the extension.

2. **Blocking Safe Searches**:
   - **Cause**: Broad keywords (e.g., "sex") triggering false positives.
   - **Fix**: Add specific domains (e.g., "google.com") to custom blocks with a negative regex (e.g., `^(?!.*google\.com)`), or report for whitelist adjustment.

3. **Extension Not Loading**:
   - **Cause**: Manifest misconfiguration.
   - **Fix**: Verify `manifest.json` permissions and file paths, then reload.

4. **Tamper Resistance Not Working**:
   - **Cause**: Chrome policy restrictions.
   - **Fix**: Ensure `management` permission is active; test in a non-incognito window.

### Debugging
- Open Chrome DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Ctrl+Shift+J`).
- Check the "Extensions" tab for errors.
- Enable verbose logging in `background.js` and `content.js` with `console.log`.
