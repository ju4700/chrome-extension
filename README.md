# Kahf Guard Chrome Extension

I tried a simple Chrome extension that allows users to easily switch between custom DNS servers for enhanced protection against dangerous websites, content, and other malicious activity.
There still might be some issues because of the lack of documantation on the the kahf guard system. It may be that it is not open to public also, I do not claim anything regarding this. You can consider this a practice project.

## Features

- Easily switch between multiple protection levels:
  - **Strong Protection**: High level of filtering against adult content and malicious sites.
  - **Medium Protection**: Moderate level of protection, focusing on harmful sites.
  - **Weak Protection**: Light filtering of potentially dangerous sites.
  - **No Protection**: Disable any DNS-based protection.
  
- Custom DNS configurations for Kahf Guard's DNS servers:
  - **Strong**: `high.kahfguard.com`
  - **Medium**: `medium.kahfguard.com`
  - **Weak**: `low.kahfguard.com`
  - **No Protection**: Direct connection, no DNS filtering.

- User-friendly interface that allows users to select protection level with a click of a button.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kahf-guard-extension.git
